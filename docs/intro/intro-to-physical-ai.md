# Introduction to Physical AI

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a convergence of artificial intelligence, robotics, and embodied cognition. Unlike traditional AI systems that interact primarily with digital data, Physical AI systems perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. These systems integrate:

- **Sensors** to perceive the environment (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, etc.)
- **Actuators** to interact with the physical world (motors, grippers, displays)
- **AI algorithms** to process information and make decisions
- **Embodied cognition** principles where the body's interaction with the environment influences intelligence

## Why Physical AI Matters

Physical AI is revolutionizing industries and daily life:

- **Healthcare**: Surgical robots, rehabilitation devices, and assistive technologies
- **Manufacturing**: Automated assembly, quality control, and collaborative robots (cobots)
- **Transportation**: Self-driving cars, delivery drones, and logistics systems
- **Space & Exploration**: Rovers, satellite maintenance, and deep-sea exploration
- **Service Industry**: Customer service robots, cleaning robots, and domestic assistants

## The 13-Week Curriculum Journey

This textbook follows a structured 13-week curriculum designed to build your Physical AI capabilities step by step:

### Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals (Weeks 1-3)
- Understanding ROS 2 architecture: nodes, topics, services, and actions

## Getting Started

To begin your journey in Physical AI, you'll need to set up your development environment. The next chapter covers ROS 2 fundamentals and will guide you through the initial setup.

Are you ready to embark on this journey of creating intelligent, embodied systems? Let's begin with ROS 2, the middleware that connects all components of Physical AI systems.

## Exercise 1.1: Reflect and Connect
Spend 10 minutes thinking about how Physical AI might impact your field of interest or daily life. Write a paragraph describing one specific application of Physical AI that excites you and explain why.

## Mini Project 1.1: Physical AI in Daily Life
Research and document three instances where Physical AI already exists in your daily environment (e.g., autonomous vacuum cleaners, smartphone face recognition, smart speakers). For each, identify the sensors, actuators, and AI components involved.
