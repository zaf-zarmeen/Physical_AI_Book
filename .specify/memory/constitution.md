# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Clarity
Content must be simple, clear, and structured for student comprehension. Every concept builds on previous knowledge with explicit connections. All explanations include practical examples from ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, or NVIDIA Isaac implementations.

### II. Multi-Platform Integration
All textbook examples and exercises must demonstrate functionality across ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac platforms. Code samples provide equivalent implementations where possible to showcase cross-platform capabilities and trade-offs.

### III. Vision-Language-Action Foundation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every chapter incorporates the Vision-Language-Action paradigm as the foundation for Physical AI. All humanoid robotics examples integrate perception, decision-making, and action in closed-loop systems with explicit vision-language components.

### IV. 13-Week Course Alignment
All content directly supports the specified 13-week course outline. Each chapter maps to specific learning objectives and includes appropriate depth for university-level coursework with laboratory components.

### V. Docusaurus Optimization
All content follows Docusaurus documentation best practices for web-based textbook delivery. Content is structured for searchability, cross-referencing, and RAG chatbot processing with clear headings and semantic markup.

### VI. Accessibility and Localization
All content must be suitable for personalization and Urdu translation. Technical terms include clear definitions, and examples avoid idiomatic language that doesn't translate well. Images, diagrams, and code are culturally neutral and universally applicable.

## Technology Standards
All textbook content must be compatible with ROS 2 ecosystem, Gazebo simulation, Unity 3D, and NVIDIA Isaac robotics platforms. Code examples follow established practices for each platform and include setup instructions. Vision-Language-Action implementations demonstrate real-world applications with humanoid robotics examples.

## Development Workflow
Content development follows iterative review cycles with domain experts in robotics, AI, and education. All chapters undergo technical accuracy review, pedagogical effectiveness assessment, and localization verification. Each chapter includes test implementations in specified technologies to verify accuracy.

## Governance
This constitution governs all textbook development decisions. Amendments require documentation of pedagogical impact, approval from three domain experts, and migration plan for existing content. All contributions must verify compliance with these principles. Use textbook development guidelines for detailed implementation practices.
